🩺 CliniScan – Chest X-ray Abnormality Detection System

CliniScan is a deep learning-based web application designed to assist in the analysis of chest X-ray images. It integrates classification, object detection, and explainability into a unified pipeline, providing both predictions and visual insights.

🧠 Project Overview

CliniScan follows a two-stage pipeline:

Classification (ResNet18) Classifies X-ray as Normal or Abnormal Detection (YOLOv8) Localizes abnormalities using bounding boxes Explainability (Grad-CAM) Highlights regions influencing model decisions

🏗️ System Architecture Input X-ray Image ↓ ResNet18 Classifier ↓ If Abnormal → YOLOv8 Detector ↓ Grad-CAM Visualization ↓ Streamlit Interface (UI)

📊 Dataset Dataset: VinDr-CXR Total Images Used: ~15,000 Train/Test Split: ~13,200 / 1,500

📈 Performance 🔹 Classification Accuracy: ~70% ROC-AUC: ~0.96 🔹 Detection Precision: ~0.55 Recall: ~0.37 mAP@50: ~0.41

✨ Features Upload chest X-ray images Binary classification (Normal / Abnormal) Abnormality detection with bounding boxes Grad-CAM visualization for explainability Confidence score display PDF report generation Usage history tracking Web-based deployment

Due to file size constraints, trained models are not stored in the repository.

They are downloaded dynamically at runtime using Google Drive links.

⚠️ Limitations Moderate detection performance (low recall) Limited dataset size Binary classification only Not clinically validated

🔮 Future Work Multi-class classification Improved detection accuracy Larger and more diverse datasets Clinical validation Integration into healthcare systems
